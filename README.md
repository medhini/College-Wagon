Problem Statement:
Buying and selling of second-hand goods (books, electronic devices, etc) inside the college among students requires an efficient and an easy to use approach so that one can find what he/she wants at the right place/time.  However, there are problems preventing the ideal vision from being a reality.
A project so that buying and selling of second hand goods in the college internally becomes easier and efficient, so that the students get benefitted by the same. 


Scope of the project:
We plan to start off with the minimal viable solution. Therefore, the project initially aims to solve the given problem for a smaller group of people (internally in the college). As we progress and succeed in above, the scope of the project can be extended to a larger audience with new ideas and revisions to our initially developed app. The ultimate aim of the app would be, to serve as an easy and an efficient way of buying/selling second hand goods.


Estimated Solution to the problem:
According to various sources and surveys, we think that there are many instances of a person in the college to sell used things to other people so that it doesn’t get wasted and the person gets the worth of the thing in hand in terms of money. This is generally the scene with most of the final year students who want to sell their things, be it books, cycles, electronic gadgets, etc. 
So, we came up with an idea so that the process of buying and selling of second hand goods inside the college internally becomes an easy process both for the buyer and the seller and the resources are used efficiently instead of getting wasted. 
We plan to develop an application for android phones to make the process of buying and selling of second hand goods inside the college. Only NITK students use this app to buy or sell whatever be the thing in hand at just the click of a button

Alternative available and problems faced:

We can use Facebook groups to solve the above problem but there are many limitations of the above. These are –
1.	Unwanted posts for members of the group not interested in buying/selling at that point of time.
2.	One needs to search if the goods he/she needs is available with someone or not, scrolling all the way down the group. 
3.	Not an efficient way (searching isn’t easy)

So we try to improve upon the above points by creating an application which consists of following – 
1.	A complete database of people who want to sell any second hand goods.
2.	Different procedure/sections for people who want to buy and sell goods.
3.	Different categories and search options for making it easy for the user to find what he/she wants in a fast and efficient way.


Technologies Used - 

CMS (Content Management System) – We use a CMS as a central interface to serve as a repository of data collected and thus helping in storing, revising, controlling and publishing documentation.

Distinguishing between the basic concepts of user and content, the content management system (CMS) has two elements:
•	Content management application (CMA) is the front-end user interface that allows a user, even with limited expertise, to add, modify and remove content from a Web site/application without the intervention of a Webmaster.
•	Content delivery application (CDA) compiles that information and updates the Web site/server.

SQLite Database – Android apps can store data locally in the SQLite database. Every Android application can create its own private SQLite databases which it can use to store data for offline reference. 

Android development does not require any specifically built hardware. The development environments based on Eclipse IDE and works on any platform.
ADT Bundle - It includes the essential Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools). 

Languages Used – Java

SQL is a standardized querying language for databases and is used across the spectrum of database management systems (MySQL).
We need to integrate MYSQL and PHP with the android application for the proper management and retrieval of data. MYSQL is used as a database at the webserver and PHP is used to fetch data from the database.



Estimated time required and Human Resources needed – 
Total Time – Approximately 2 months
Deadlines/Checkpoints – Not decided yet
Human resources needed – People to mentor in areas of database management and issues related to android application development.


Literature Survey – 
There are currently many websites/applications which are there in the market to serve as a platform for buying and selling of second hand goods over internet.
These include – 
www.olx.in
www.quikr.com

These are really good platforms for buying and selling of online goods at just one place and have many benefits which make the process a completely hassle-free one.
These are – 
	Design and post ads with images.
	Manage your products from your account.
	Set your products’ costs and find a product/service at your desired price.
	Access them from your cell phone with its mobile friendly interface.
	Greater Reach

This inspired us to create a market inside the college and make the process of buying and selling online with a hassle-free process. As and when we grow, we review and revise our application by taking surveys from the users after every stage so that whatever feedback they give, can be implemented and we can expect a bigger number of users every time we come up with something new.

Unique points about our application – 
1.	It serves to a smaller group of people. Starting off with the minimal viable form of the app turns out to be an advantage for this application. Since our app will cater to only the students on NITK, it is advantageous for both buyers and sellers.
2.	We just act as an intermediate medium for buyers and sellers. To get information from sellers and to give information to buyers is what all we do. Buyers and sellers can actually meet up and negotiate over the deal.
3.	An app is much better than just a group over which spreading details of things to be sold is done, as discussed in the solution. The buyer can easily search for anything he wants and find the appropriate seller in a very fast and efficient way.
4.	The users forget to pull down the sales advertisement and it lingers on, keeping everybody’s hopes up. We plan to make the ad invisible after one month time. The same ad can be set to ‘Visible’ again by user’s choice. If the ad remains ‘Invisible’ for another month, it gets deleted.
5.	This will help removing waste stuff from the database and keeps the app fast and efficient.
